Adding a user with sudo privileges for SSH access

# useradd john

Create a home folder and a hidden folder that SSH expects within that home folder. Normally, this is two commands but you can use the -p flag with the mkdir command to tell the system to create folders as necessary. 

# mkdir -p /home/john/.ssh
# ls -lah /home/john

Set up password for user John

# passwd john

Need to add john to the sudoers file, but not directly.

# visudo
/(ALL)
then hi "i" for insert

Underneith the line that reads:
root 	ALL=(ALL)	ALL

Add this

john 	ALL=(ALL) 	ALL

Then

esc
wq

Logout

# logut

Disable the ability of the root user to log in via SSH

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
/PermitRootLogin
Insert mode - type i
PermitRootLogin from yes to no
escape
wq

Restart service 

# sudo service sshd restart
